**Note:** This project is under active development and continuously being improved for better performance and interactivity. New features and bug fixes are added regularly to optimize the 3D experience.

An Electron.js desktop application with a React and TypeScript setup, built to create a dynamic 3D pipe screensaver. This project is a nod to the nostalgic Windows 95 pipe screensaver but with modern technologies and improved visual effects.

## Technologies Used

- **Electron.js**: Desktop application framework.
- **Three.js**: For rendering 3D graphics and animations.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.
